# Dotfiles

> **Noun** - Plural of dotfile
>
> 1. (computing) A file or directory whose name begins with a dot (period or full stop), typically hidden from view.

In Unix systems the term dotfiles is referred to the files that are hidden from view in your home directory and are used to personalize your system. **In this repo you can find my dotfiles!**

## Disclaimer

Before just installing the dotfiles I created blindfolded, please have a look at the code and ask yourself the question:

_Don't I have other needs that my work environment has to fullfil in order to really aid me whilst using it?_

What I'm trying to say is that you should rather use my dotfiles as a template to create your own ones, instead of just installing them. Also my dotfiles are created in oder to function perfectly on a Mac as of now. So if you are using a different platform my dotfiles may contain some functionality that will not work for you _(I'm sorry)_.
